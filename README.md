# social-network-analysis-project
Social network analysis project based on twitter data, an assignment for a grad level course in Fall 2019

In this project, I did the social network analysis based on twitter data from one month in 2009. The hashtag I chose for 
the analysis is #facebook. 

There are 4 main parts in this assignment project: build a mention graph, content analysis, centrality analysis, and 
connectivity patterns.
